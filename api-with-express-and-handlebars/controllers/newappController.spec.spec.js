Your question appears to be on the right track. However, for the sake of completeness, adding scenarios to ensure the bent function is called with the correct parameters for each function is necessary. Let's revise and add some tests to cover those scenarios. Furthermore, we could test when the list of versions returned by bent is empty.

```typescript
test('minimumSecurePage should handle valid outcomes', async () => {
  const output = [{ version: '1.0.0', security: true }, { version: '2.0.0', security: false }];
  (bent as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(output);
  
  await minimumSecurePage(req as Request, res as Response);

  expect(bent).toHaveBeenCalledWith('GET', 'json', {version: '1.0.0', security: true});
  expect(res.render).toHaveBeenCalled();
});

test('latestReleasesPage should handle valid outcomes', async () => {
  const output = [{ version: '1.0.0' }, { version: '2.0.0' }];
  (bent as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(output);
  
  await latestReleasesPage(req as Request, res as Response);

  expect(bent).toHaveBeenCalledWith('GET', 'json', {version: '1.0.0'});
  expect(res.render).toHaveBeenCalled();
});

test('minimumSecure should handle valid outcomes', async () => {
  const output = [{ version: '1.0.0', security: true }, { version: '2.0.0', security: false }];
  (bent as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(output);
  
  await minimumSecure(req as Request, res as Response);

  expect(bent).toHaveBeenCalledWith('GET', 'json', {version: '1.0.0', security: true});
  expect(res.json).toHaveBeenCalled();
});

test('latestReleases should handle valid outcomes', async () => {
  const output = [{ version: '1.0.0' }, { version: '2.0.0' }];
  (bent as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(output);
  
  await latestReleases(req as Request, res as Response);

  expect(bent).toHaveBeenCalledWith('GET', 'json', {version: '1.0.0'});
  expect(res.json).toHaveBeenCalled();
});

test('latestReleases should handle empty list', async () => {
  const output = [];
  (bent as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(output);

  await latestReleases(req as Request, res as Response);

  expect(bent).toHaveBeenCalledWith('GET', 'json');
  expect(res.json).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ message: 'No data available' });
});
```
The last test would need you to have extra handling in your `latestReleases` method where you check if data is there and, if it's not, respond with a message saying 'No data available'. You could do similar for the other methods as well if you wanted to.

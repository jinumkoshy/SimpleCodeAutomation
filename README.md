# GitHub Actions Pipeline: Automated Code Review, Security Review, and Unit Test Creation

## Overview

This pipeline automates:
1. **Code Review**: Checks code quality and adherence to best practices.
2. **Security Review**: Detects vulnerabilities and anti-patterns.
3. **Unit Test Creation**: Generates and validates unit tests.

Triggered when a pull request (PR) is created, the pipeline provides automated feedback by:
- Creating a new branch with review comments.
- Raising a separate PR for suggested changes.

---

## Features
- **Code Review**: Automated feedback on code quality and standards.
- **Security Analysis**: Early detection of vulnerabilities.
- **Unit Test Generation**: Automatically creates and validates tests using Jest.

---

## Workflow Architecture

### Trigger
- **Event**: The pipeline is triggered by a pull request creation.

### Steps
1. **Code Analysis**:
   - Use OpenAI to review code changes for quality and security.
   - Suggest improvements and identify issues.
2. **Unit Test Generation**:
   - OpenAI generates unit tests for the modified code.
   - Tests are added to the repository and validated with Jest.
3. **Feedback Branch**:
   - A new branch (e.g., `review-comments-<PR-ID>`) is created.
   - The branch contains review suggestions and generated tests.
4. **Pull Request Creation**:
   - A PR is raised to merge the feedback branch into the base branch.

### Workflow Diagram


## Technical Details

### Code Review
- **Tool**: OpenAI API
- **Output**: Suggestions and improvements are added to a new branch.

### Security Review
- **Tool**: OpenAI API
- **Output**: Identifies vulnerabilities and anti-patterns.

### Unit Test Creation
- **Framework**: Jest
- **Process**:
  - OpenAI generates tests based on code changes.
  - Tests are validated in the pipeline.

---

## Security Considerations
1. **API Key Management**:
   - Store OpenAI API keys securely using GitHub Secrets.
2. **Data Privacy**:
   - Only send necessary code snippets to OpenAI for analysis.

---

## Deployment

### Steps
1. Set up GitHub Actions workflows in your repository.
2. Add the OpenAI API key to the repository secrets.
3. Test the pipeline in a staging environment.

### Rollback
- Revert to the previous stable version of the workflow file in case of issues.
